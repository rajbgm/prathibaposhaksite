        <p>If you are passionate about teaching any of the following subjects, you can express your interest to be a teacher.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Elementary and High school mathematics with interesting, daily-life applications and the “why” of every formula</li>
          <li>Reasoning and problem-solving skills through engaging puzzles</li>
          <li>Physics, Chemistry or Biology with great passion, clarity and joy</li>
          <li>English language (reading, writing and speaking)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should love to make your classes interactive and enable the students to think for prolonged duration and arrive at the answers/proofs.</p>
        <p><b>As the students are from Kannada medium schools,</b> it is ideal if you can teach in Kannada... However, if you cannot teach or speak in Kannada, we would still like to hear from you.</p>
